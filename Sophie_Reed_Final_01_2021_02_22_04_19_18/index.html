			<h1>STAR GENERATOR</h1>
			<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
			<p>This is a GUI, or a generative web application I created in p5js. Certain variables of the star I created can be manipulated by the interface on the right side of the screen.</p>
			<h2>PARAMETERS:</h2>
			<p>These are the custom controls I added to customize my star function. You can change the sliders to change the GUI!</p>

			<ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled">
				<li>points: this adjusts how many points the star has.</li>
				<li>stroke: this changes how thick the black border is on the star. </li>
				<li>radius1: this manipulates the radius. </li>
				<li>radius2: this manipulates the radius as well. </li>
				<li>rotate: this function rotates the star. </li>
				<li>r: this manipulates the red tones in the middle of the star. </li>
				<li>g: this manipulates the green tones in the middle of the star. </li>
				<li>b: this manipulates the blue tones in the middle of the star. </li>
				<li>alpha: this changes how pigmented the color in the middle of the star is. </li>
				<li>color: this manipulates the background color. </li>

			</ul>

			<h2>MY PROCESS:</h2>
			<p>This was a learning experience for me as it was my first time learning many of these programs. I have experience in HTML, CSS, Brackets and Github thankfully, but JavaScript is all new. I am enjoying the challenge. I have been following along in class and going back to look at the recorded video lectures to keep myself up to date.</p>
